# Six Sigma Yellow Belt Project: Reducing Downtime Through Process Optimization

This repository presents a complete Six Sigma Yellow Belt project focused on identifying and reducing avoidable downtime within a critical maintenance workflow. The project applies the DMAIC methodology to analyze, improve, and control a real-world industrial process using data-driven techniques and lean thinking.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To identify the root causes of excessive downtime in a maintenance process and implement targeted improvements to reduce average response time and improve equipment availability.

## 📁 Project Artifacts

### 📌 Charters
- [`Yellow Belt Project Charter`](./charter/Yellow_Belt_Project_Charter.pdf)  
  Defines the scope, objectives, problem statement, and expected impact.

- [`Team Charter`](./charter/Team_Charter.pdf)  
  Clarifies roles, responsibilities, communication plan, and meeting cadence.

### 🧪 Analysis & Planning
- [`Data Collection Plan`](./analysis/Data_Collection_Plan.pdf)  
  Describes the data sources, measurement methods, sampling frequency, and tools used.

- [`Hypotheses`](./analysis/Hypotheses.pdf)  
  Initial assumptions related to downtime causes, tested during the Analyze phase.

- [`Lessons Learned`](./analysis/Lessons_Learned.pdf)  
  Key insights, obstacles, and what worked during the project lifecycle.

### 🛠 Process Understanding
- [`SIPOC Diagram`](./process/SIPOC_Diagram.pdf)  
  High-level process visualization: Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers.

- [`Process Map`](./process/Process_Map.pdf)  
  Visual flow of the current process, used to identify non-value-adding steps.

## 🔍 Methodology

This project followed the **DMAIC cycle**:

- **Define** – Framed the problem and business case through the Project Charter
- **Measure** – Designed and executed a structured Data Collection Plan
- **Analyze** – Formulated and tested hypotheses on root causes
- **Improve** – Proposed countermeasures and process improvements
- **Control** – Defined actions for sustaining improvements and measuring outcomes

---

## 📈 Outcomes

- Identified two key root causes of downtime
- Proposed SOP update and technician shift alignment
- Created baseline metrics for long-term monitoring
- Delivered team alignment and process awareness through visual tools
